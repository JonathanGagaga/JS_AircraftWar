# Pencil Pilot
I have worked on this since December 2017.    

I didn't know much about JS or even what actually coding was.  

I seeked tons of help from other online resources and finally figured out how to write control-status method to make the game more structured.    

From time to time, I still want to add other deisgns into this game to make it more engaging and challenged.
